Vega Tofurkey Optional Assignment
===

- JS
- JQ
- SQL

Updated version of our Week 1 Review project. Here, everything has been set up to use an array of items on the server. 

This is a completely optional set of challenges that should help solidify the material we've traversed and should be tackled only after the Weekend Challenge has been completed. This exists to keep you sharp and offer more practice. It is not graded, but is recommended with the long break this week. 

- Challenge 1: Install pg and add SQL database functionality to the server side for persistent data

- Challenge 2: Add the "filter" functionality that we used in the in-class version

- Challenge 3: Add The ability to "remove" an item. Add a button for each item to the list. When clicked, it should send an AJAX request for this item to be removed from the DB.

- Challenge 4: Add an "update" feature. Maybe the user input the wrong size or mistyped a description. Instead of making them delete the item and add again, add the ability to update an existing item.
